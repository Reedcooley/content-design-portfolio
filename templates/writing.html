        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Our Help Center article on passkeys expanded over time as industry adoption and our own investment in passkeys grew. As the article became more overloaded with information, we saw a drop in its helpfulness score and received feedback that some visitors found the article confusing.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I revamped the article with the aim of making it easier to navigate and improving the helpfulness score.</p>

            <p><strong>Challenges</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Users have widely variable knowledge about passkeys.</li>
              <li>Users are searching for "passkeys" for different reasons—from general information to specific documentation on using them in our product.</li>
              <li>Passkeys depend on complex technology, but the user experience is simple and familiar, which may confuse users about why it's such a big deal.</li>
            </ul>
          <p><strong>Approach</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I created a parent article for all passkey-related questions, providing a high-level intro to passkeys and directing users to the appropriate content based on whether they need general info or product-specific documentation.</li>
            <li>I developed focused child articles that deal with specific product documentation and deeper details.</li>
            <li>In tandem with our product marketing and support teams, I created a series of articles explaining how to use our app to set up and store passkeys for specific sites like Amazon and GitHub.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Before and after</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240522030313/https://support.dashlane.com/hc/en-us/articles/7888558064274-Passkeys-in-Dashlane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="View the previous version in the Wayback Machine which opens in a new tab">View the previous version in the Wayback Machine</a></li>

          </ul>
          <p><strong>Results</strong>: I'm still gathering data as this was a recent revamp. But similar approaches on other topics led to sustained helpfulness-score increases of as much as 12 percentage points. These revamps have also given me much more granular insight into what’s working and what’s not, as the child articles are more targeted, allowing me to identify which specific content users are voting up or down.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Our company upholds a zero-knowledge principle, meaning we protect user data such that even company employees don’t have access to it. We introduced a new feature that detects if a user's password has been found on the dark web. Before release, we anticipated that some users might be confused about how the feature complies with our zero-knowledge policy.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I created an FAQ question to explain how dark web monitoring works without exposing user passwords.</p>

          <div><strong>Challenges</strong>: 
          <ul>
            <li>Users have varying levels of technical proficiency, and few of them are cybersecurity engineers.</li>
            <li>Explaining dark web monitoring accurately requires highly technical engineering terms.</li>
            <li>Some users will find this question essential while others won't be worried about it at all.</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <div><strong>Approach</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>I created an FAQ to explain the feature.</li>
            <li>I introduced technical concepts like hash functions and k-anonymity with short, straightforward definitions before explaining how they're used in the feature.</li>
            <li>I folded the FAQ into an accordion header for easy access without overwhelming the article with technical detail.</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <div><strong>Results</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>Positive feedback from marketing, security, and engineering teams.</li>
            <li>Successful high-profile launch with no reports of user confusion.</li>
