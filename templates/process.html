     <!-- Visible by default --> <p><strong>Problem</strong>: As a blog or support website grows, it can be difficult to keep track of pages and other associated information like page locations, labels, and authors.</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I created a script that pulls metadata for all pages on a Zendesk-based site automatically into a shared team spreadsheet.</p>s
      <div class="more-content">
        <p><strong>Impact</strong>: </p> <ul> <li>Saved hours of manual work each month.</li> <li> Eliminated gaps and errors in article metadata. </li> <li> Built foundation for additional automation such as broken link checks and macro tracking. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Details</strong>: The script exports article metadata from Zendesk API at regular intervals, reformats the data, and imports it to a shared spreadsheet on Google Sheets. You can sort or filter the spreadsheet by article creation date, category, section, label, and so on. This allows you to efficiently manage your content.</p>

  <!-- ===================== -->
  <div class="project-section" id="broken-links">
    <div class="project-header">
      <h2>Broken link finder</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="project-content">
      <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Even if careful link checks are built into the content management process, broken links can occur for all kinds of reasons.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I created a script that checks automatically for broken links and exports the link info to a shared spreadsheet.</p>
      <!-- Hidden content -->
       <div class="more-content"> <p><strong>Impact</strong>: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced time-to-discovery from days or weeks to less than 24 hours.</li> <li>Improved user experience by eliminating broken links on the site.</li>
          <li>Provided a simple way for non-technical team members to identify and fix broken links.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Details</strong>: The script checks all links in published articles and exports info regarding broken links to a shared spreadsheet in Google Sheets. The spreadsheet displays the number of broken links found in each article for each locale as well as the error code encountered. </p>
        <p>The script is intended to return some false positives. For example, if the target page of a link requires authentication, the link still appears on the list. In this situation, you can manually select the ignore box in the spreadsheet. If the same link and error code appear the next time you run the script, the ignore box remains selected. </p>
