        <!-- Visible by default -->
        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Localizing a website is costly, time-consuming, and potentially error-prone.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I developed an LLM-powered app that can integrate with content management systems and provides inexpensive, instantaneous, and high-quality translations.</p>

        <!-- Hidden content -->
        <div class="more-content">
              <p><strong>Impact</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Reduced translation costs by over 99%.</li>
                  <li>Reduced translation time from days or weeks to minutes.</li>
                  <li>Eliminated gaps in translated content due to process problems.</li>
                  <li>Gave the team more oversight regarding the translation process and quality control.</li>
                </ul>
          <p><strong>Details</strong>: Modern LLMs are excellent translators, especially for simple, concrete writing such as you find in good support content.</p>
          <p>The translation app includes these features: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Integration with Zendesk and any major LLM.
            </li>
            <li>Bulk translation of multiple articles at once.
            </li>
            <li>Targeted translation of individual articles and ability to preview updates before publishing.
            </li> 
            <li>"Full translation" of entire articles or "partial translation" that automatically translates only the sections of each article that have been updated.</li> 
            <li>Ad hoc translation of shorter texts.
            </li> 
            <li>Integration with an in-house glossary.</li> 
          </ul>

      <div class="project-content">
        <!-- Visible by default -->
        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Company knowledge is routinely scattered across multiple tools, making it difficult to find answers quickly. Traditional keyword search across multiple knowledge bases often returns too many irrelevant results.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I led a team that designed a hackathon-winning prototype integrating all company knowledge bases into a single AI-powered semantic search tool.</p>
        <!-- Hidden content -->
        <div class="more-content">
            <p><strong>Impact</strong>: Won the internal hackathon, validating the approach and garnering enthusiasm for a production-ready version of the tool.</p>
          <p><strong>Details</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Worked with tools team, IT, and engineering to design pipeline for integrating data from Confluence, Zendesk, and WordPress with a single AI search tool.</li>
            <li>Created a simple UI exposing a single search bar on our Help Center site with source filters and deep links.</li>
            <li>Worked with security team to align architecture to company security posture.</li>
            <li>Commissioned and oversaw creation of an engaging wrap-up video for the hackathon closing ceremony.</li>

        <h2>Living article management spreadsheet</h2>
            <!-- Read More Link in header -->
      </div>
      <div class="project-content">
        <!-- Visible by default -->
        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: As a blog or support website grows, it can be difficult to keep track of pages and other associated information like page locations, labels, and authors.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I created a script that pulls metadata for all pages on a Zendesk-based site automatically into a shared team spreadsheet.</p>

        <!-- Hidden content -->
          <div class="more-content">
            <p><strong>Impact</strong>:   </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Saved hours of manual work each month.</li>
                <li>
                  Eliminated gaps and errors in article metadata.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Built foundation for additional automation such as broken link checks and macro tracking.  
                </li>
              </ul>

            <p><strong>Details</strong>: The script exports article metadata from Zendesk API at regular intervals, reformats the data, and imports it to a shared spreadsheet on Google Sheets. You can sort or filter the spreadsheet by article creation date, category, section, label, and so on. This allows you to efficiently manage your content.</p>

            <div id="test-process" style="display: none;">
              <p><strong>Test the process</strong>: Enter the subdomain of any Zendesk-based site (e.g. "slack" or "mailchimp"). For the purposes of the test, the article data will download to a CSV rather than exporting to Google Sheets. 
              <strong>Note</strong>: Some sites created an authentication layer for this API endpoint. In those cases the test won't work.</p>

              <label for="subdomain">Enter your Zendesk subdomain:</label>

      <div class="project-content">
        <!-- Visible by default -->
        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Even if careful link checks are built into the content management process, broken links can occur for all kinds of reasons.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I created a script that checks automatically for broken links and exports the link info to a shared spreadsheet.</p>

        <!-- Hidden content -->
        <div class="more-content">
            <p><strong>Impact</strong>:  </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Reduced time-to-discovery from days or weeks to less than 24 hours.</li>
                <li>Improved user experience by eliminating broken links on the site.</li>
                <li>Provided a simple way for non-technical team members to identify and fix broken links.</li>
              </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Details</strong>: The script checks all links in published articles and exports info regarding broken links to a shared spreadsheet in Google Sheets. The spreadsheet displays the number of broken links found in each article for each locale as well as the error code encountered.
          </p>
          <p>The script is intended to return some false positives. For example, if the target page of a link requires authentication, the link still appears on the list. In this situation, you can manually select the ignore box in the spreadsheet. If the same link and error code appear the next time you run the script, the ignore box remains selected.
